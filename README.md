dailyCompliment
===============

See the app in production at: dailycompliment.meteor.com

Future Plans
- If a carrier is entered that is not supported by the app, inform the user the carrier is not supported, but let them know to check back later. Send a notification to developer with the unsupported carrier so that it can be implemented.

- Have users confirm their registration before setting up a subscription

- Handle the unsubscribe path differently. I don't like that it is dependent on an error being thrown.
