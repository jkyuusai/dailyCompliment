dailyCompliment
===============
Sign up to get a compliment emailed to you once a day! Enter your email address in the subscription form again to unsubscribe at any time. You are automatically unsubscribed after seven days.

Give the app a try [here](http://dailycompliment.meteor.com/)

*Sometimes during peak usage times, Meteor's hosting can be a little unresponive. If Meteor reports that the site is unavailable, try refreshing the page.*


I's built using the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) framework.

Future Plans
- Have users confirm their registration before setting up a subscription
- Highlight the unsubscribe path better
- Handle the unsubscribe path differently so that it is not dependent on an error being thrown
- Allow users to specify personal frequency of compliments
- Make scheduler be more consistent
